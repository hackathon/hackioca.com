## Introduction
Hack the North created and branded a hackathon as an April Fools prank. A part of that process was creating a site that has:
- Interactive "Build-Your-Boba" (change flavors and toppings on cup)
- Background changes toppings & moves on scroll
- About, schedule, judges, workshops, activities, sponsors, prizes, FAQ sections
- Navbar & footer

## Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/hackathon/hackioca.com.git
cd hackioca.com
npm install
npm start
```

It should open automatically, but if not access the site at: http://localhost:3000/
